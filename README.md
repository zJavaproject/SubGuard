# SubGuard
How often does it happen to you to sign up for a free trial period that later turns out to be a subscription about which you forget? The money is slipping out of your account and the storage on your phone is running out because too many apps, until there's a moment of great reflection and you want to give up all of that stuff and start with a clean slate. 

We found a solution which will help you with managing all your paid subscriptions from the level of single app.

SubGuard is collecting all your subscriptions - whether you add them manually or by scanning your bank statement for regular payments and then track the time of your last activity and how long you were using it. 

Let's take for example Netflix. When you add your subscription you need to provide a price of your plan and if your using different device to watch movies credentials to your Netflix account. Based on logs we can show you how much time did you spend f.ex. last week using that app and when was the last time you opened it. When the period from the last usage and the current date exceed specific amount of time you'll get a notification that maybe you should check if you still need that subscription.

Let's be honest we all want to have more money on the accounts, so why not to start from the smallest payments that usually goes under our radar?
